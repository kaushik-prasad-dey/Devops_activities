1) Create a VPC - "3tier-architecture" with CIDR 10.20.0.0/16.
2) Create 3 subnets - 1 Public -web and 2 private -app and db.
3) Launch "web1" and "web2" instances in Subnet "web".
4) Launch "app1" and "app2" instances in subnet "app".
5) Launch "db1" in subnet "db".
6) "web1" and "web2" are basic httpd web servers and should be connectable from
   internet on ports 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP). test it.
7) "app1" and "app2" should only be connectable fro "web1" and "web2"
using Private IP address over port 22 (SSH).
8) "db1" should be connectable only from "app1" and "app2" using Private IP address over
  port(SSH).
